# libPyAgentConfiguration v1.0

Easy management of agent configuration for monitoring daemons or services.

The project was born from the need for a Python library that allows for easy configuration management of monitoring agents.

Monitoring agents, as their name suggests, monitor and validate the status of a daemon or service running on the operating system and notify via Telegram if it isn't working correctly.
